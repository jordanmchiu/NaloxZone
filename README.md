**NaloxZone Vancouver** is a web app that provides a fast and convenient way to locate pharmacies near you that carry
Naloxone kits and provide overdose training.  It makes use of the Google Maps Platform and data publicly available from
the BC Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions to provide accurate information about the location of every pharmacy
in Vancouver that provides Naloxone.

Click anywhere on the map to set your location, which will be marked by a star '*'.
The app will display up to the five closest pharmacies to your location, numbered in increasing order of distance.

You can also choose to display only pharmacies that have been confirmed to provide overdose training.  From the
same location, you'll see only the pharmacies that provide overdose training:
